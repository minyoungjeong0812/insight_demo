# week1_insight

This readme is for the 1st week demo. I want to analyze which Superbowl commerical ads have collected most positive reviews from critics and general users by scraping web data and possible theme pattern recognition. This can be used to predict the succesful launch of potential ads for big companies that can risk spending a lot of money, or can be used by small companies to learn a lesson on how to maximize their branding power through succesful ads.

# DATA

I used https://admeter.usatoday.com/2019/02/04/the-top-5-super-bowl-liii-ads-according-to-ad-meter/
for web scraping

# Week2_insight

So I ended up pivoting but the project should be fun. I am working on predicting an anomalous behavior based on gaming user stats in Player Unknown's Battle Ground (PUBG). All the user stat data is being scraped from https://pubg.op.gg/. The users and matches are randomly selected by using official PUBG API. 

# Week3_insight

(Almost) Final product has been created. I used Flask + Dash to create a web app where end users can find the cheaters and view their actual stats. The current dataset contains ~55,000 rows with ~2,700 users. This represents the data of 20 most recent matches for each user. My algorithm is based on Bayesian inference to find the anmalous behaviors including high number of kills or damage in PUBG games. Enjoy.
