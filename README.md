# week1_insight

This readme is for the 1st week demo. I want to analyze which Superbowl commerical ads have collected most positive reviews from critics and general users by scraping web data and possible theme pattern recognition. This can be used to predict the succesful launch of potential ads for big companies that can risk spending a lot of money, or can be used by small companies to learn a lesson on how to maximize their branding power through succesful ads.

# DATA

I used https://admeter.usatoday.com/2019/02/04/the-top-5-super-bowl-liii-ads-according-to-ad-meter/
for web scraping
